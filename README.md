##  Skills
- **Excel**
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
  
##  Key Steps Implemented
1. Imported required libraries and loaded the Zomato dataset.  
2. Cleaned data, e.g., removed “/5” from the ratings to convert them into floats.  
3. Checked data integrity (e.g., nulls, data types) and cleaned where needed.  
4. Visualized restaurant types and their relative popularity.  
5. Aggregated votes by restaurant type and plotted trends.  
6. Determined the most-voted restaurant.  
7. Explored online order availability and its correlation with ratings.  
8. Analyzed rating distributions and price preferences for couples.  
9. Compared rating distributions between online vs offline orders.  
10. Created a heatmap to show the relationship between restaurant type and order mode.

##  Major Insights
- **Dining** was the most common restaurant type; it also received the most votes.  
- Most restaurants **do not accept online orders**.  
- Ratings typically clustered between **3.5 to 4**.  
- Couples mostly preferred mid-range restaurants (₹300).  
- Restaurants that accepted **online orders achieved higher ratings**.  
- **Dining** restaurants favored offline orders, while **cafes** leaned toward online orders
